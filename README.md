# hifi-buildscripts
Build scripts for various Linux distributions - no support given.

I don't maintian this is either the best, only or even right way to compile High Fidelity's VR Server/Client programs, but, it's what works for me and has prvoven overall reliable in face of constant changes that break HF compiling all too routinely.

This will (possibly) work for **only** the following Linux based distribtutions;

1) Ubuntu Xenial (16.04)
2) Ubuntu Artful (17.10)
3) Debian Buster (10.0 -- currently in Debian's "testing" phase)
4) openSUSE Tumbleweed

Each of above has a subdirectory with its specific build scripts and notes.

It will not work for anything else that's not at least an almost identical clone for packages to one of the above.  I.E. It *might* work for Linux Mint based on Ubuntu 17.10, but, is neither tested on or planned to be tested on any distributions not explicitly listed.
