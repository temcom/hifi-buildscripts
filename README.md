Build scripts for various Linux distributions - no support given.

If you wish to reference my work on your blog/wiki/whatever do **not** copy my scripts, reference back to here and credit me for these works.

I don't maintian this is either the best, only or even right way to compile High Fidelity's VR Server/Client programs, but, it's what works for me and has prvoven overall reliable in face of constant changes that break HF compiling all too routinely.

This will (possibly) work for **only** the following Linux based distribtutions;

1) Ubuntu Xenial (16.04)
2) Ubuntu Artful (17.10) -- Will be dropped in July 2018 when Artful is "retired".
3) Debian Buster (10.0) -- Buster is currently in Debian's "testing" phase.
4) openSUSE Tumbleweed
5) Fedora 27 -- 27 is currently forming for release sometime in December, it works at the moment.

Each of above has a subdirectory with its specific build scripts and notes.

It will not work for anything else that's not at least an almost identical clone for packages to one of the above.
