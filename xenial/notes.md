Xenial is a real pain due to needing PPA and it being barely capable of properly supporting HiFi's "bleeding edge everything" approach.  I tested this build method using VirtualBox and this is how I setup its VM.

I used Ubuntu's net install ISO -- http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/xenial-updates/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/

I worked through various install steps and selected only 2 additional (to the one already enabled) package groups; OpenSSH Server and Basic Ubuntu Server.

Once installed and booted I then added packages via list provided.
