# If you would like to improve this script then by all means offer a pull request.
# Do not file comments saying you should do this or that, do it yourself and offer a pull request.
# There's no assurance this will work ongoing -- It depends upon High Fidelity not breaking its
# make files (a routine occurence) and certain packages being at certain level in Artful.  It's likely
# Artful will remain compatible through its lifespan (Summer 2018) - unless HiFi moves to a new
# bleeding edge.
