# Do not file comments saying you should do this or that, do it yourself and offer a pull request.
# There's no assurance this will work ongoing -- It depends upon High Fidelity not breaking its
# make files (a routine occurence) and certain packages being at certain level in Tumbleweed (not
# an assured proposition since Tumbleweed is all about the bleeding edge -- it just so happens that
# its current bleeding edge aligns perfectly with what HiFi needs).
